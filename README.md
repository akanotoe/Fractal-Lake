# Fractal Lake
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/akanotoe/Fractal-Lake/main)

Python code to calculate the fractal dimension of a set of data representing a coastline.

The fractal-lake.ipynb notebook imports data on Crater Lake in Oregon and uses the box-counting method to obtain the fractal dimension of the coastline.

L-systems.ipynb is a notebook which generates fractal plots using L-system rules. The notebook is based on code found [here](https://elc.github.io/posts/plotting-fractals-step-by-step-with-python/).
